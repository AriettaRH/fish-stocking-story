      <h1>Fish Stocking: The Hidden Hero Behind Your Favorite Fishing Hole</h1>

      <p>Every year on April 1st, flocks of anglers hit the water to celebrate the first day of fishing season.</p>

      <p>The people who stock those fishing spots with natural species work year-round to keep the sport sustainable. Stocking fish helps enhance the fishing experience and aims to "restore native species to waters they formerly occupied," according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
      <p>The DEC operates 12 state-run hatcheries that rear thousands of fish for stocking each season, according to their website. But Onondaga County is home to the only county-run facility in the state: Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery. Since 1938, Carpenter's Brook employees have worked with DEC partners and volunteers to manage county fish populations and improve local recreation sustainably. Eric Stanczyk, who runs the program, says understanding this unique stocking process can help Syracuse fishermen track down their next catch.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping that the fishermen who go out will catch some of these fish and enjoy some of them," Stanczyk said.
</p>
      <p>The fish stocking process starts long before the hatchery-grown fish hits the water. Workers retrieve fish from trap nets to collect their eggs and milt before releasing them, according to the DEC. They then use the collected milt to fertilize the eggs, which are sent to hatcheries like Carpenter's Brook to hatch and grow. Trout, Carpenter Brook's most stocked species, was grown to an average of 9-10 inches in 2022, according to DEC data. Stanczyk said growing fish to this size can take over a year of work.</p>
      <p>"The fish that we're stocking out are one-year-olds or two-year-olds," Stanczyk said.
</p>
<p>Aside from the extensive time scale, hatcheries also spawn and stock a large quantity of fish. In April 2022 alone, over 20,000 rainbow trout were stocked in Onondaga County. Stanczyk said trout were the most popular fish to stock because they're a "cold, fresh, clean water fish" that thrives in the natural ecosystem.
</p>
<p>"I think the popularity of brown trout is because the waters of central New York are more suited for them, they can handle the temperature swings." Stanczyk said.

    <div class="story-text">
      <p>Since stockers drop trout in streams during spring and early summer, April is the best time to go out and catch them. There are some "absolutely amazing trout streams" in Onondaga County, all of which are within ten minutes from the city, according to Stanczyk. One popular, well-stocked fishing spot that Stanczyk recommends is Butternut Creek. He said fishers would overtax popular spots like Butternut Creek without stocking, making the sport impossible due to dwindling fish counts. 
</p>
      <p>"They would be putting more and more stress on an already taxed wild resource that can't withstand that kind of pressure," Stanczyk said.
</p>
      <p>Recreational fishing is not the only tax that native fish populations face. While the brook trout is the native state fish of New York State, environmental impacts like acid rain and invasive species have threatened the species' survival. The DEC encourages fishermen to follow state regulations on how many fish can be kept. Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery uses DEC data to stock fish in a way that suits and supports the natural ecosystem.
</p>
      <p>"We work with the State DEC to determine what some of the holding numbers are in the streams, what that stream can withstand with our stocking policies, and the amount of fishing pressure that some of those streams get. So you have to look at what the stream could take," Stanczyk said.
</p>
      <p>Onondaga County Parks offers stocking lists with specifics on the waterbody, species, and numbers stocked. This information is updated weekly on their fishing webpage, fishonondagacounty.com.

      <p>Every spring, Carpenter's Brook enlists the help of community volunteers to stock favorite fishing holes across Onondaga County.
</p>
      <p>"Somebody has to carry the bucket down to the stream to release the fish. It is fairly labor-intensive. And that's where the volunteers come in," Stanczyk said, "We couldn't do it without the volunteers."

<div class="caption">The data in this story was compiled from 2022 fish stocking lists provided by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) in Onondaga County. The DEC runs its own fish hatcheries and works with Carpenterâ€™s Brook Fish Hatchery, the only county-run facility in the state. Together, they enlist employees and volunteers each season to stock local waterways.
